# About Me, Hasani Rogers.

Hello. I'm a Front End Developer who's been in the business since around 2001. I started making web sites from a crappy homestead (for those that remember) WYSIWYG tool. I quickly learned that WYSIWYG tools sucked so I taught my self HTML using Front Page 2003 (gasp). I also taught myself PHP by installing plugins for phpBB. At the time, you had to install those bad boys by hand. I eventually went to school and got a degree in Computer Science. But most of my knowledge comes with just tinkering with things, reading blogs, watching videos, and getting frustrated with crazy code on the job.

I enjoy the creative part of being a developer. The reason I started build sites in the first place was to tell my stories. I really enjoy [Lit Element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) as you probably can tell from my blog posts. I enjoy it so much I've created a library of components based on it called [Kemet](http://kemet.online). But I think React is cool too (I got my eye out on [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)). I'm a believer of web components in general because I think framework agnosticism is smart. Just checkout out [this list of cool web component resources](https://github.com/web-padawan/awesome-lit-html).

I created this blog because I believe code should be as simple as possible. There's a lot of info on the web with overly complicated examples of how to go about doing things. I like to get straight to the point with example. That and they say that the best way to learn is to become a teacher. So here I am. I am constantly learning and I'd like to share what I've learned with you!
